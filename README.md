## Introduction

This a PowerBI Project aimed to address the significant drop in customer satisfaction, with the satisfaction rate dipping under 50% for the first time at **Dano Airlines**, a UK-based airline headquartered in London, United Kingdom. To address this challenge, a data-driven strategy is proposed to improve satisfaction levels across key areas. Through analysis of passenger feedback and evaluation of various factors influencing satisfaction.

## Data Source

The dataset was given by Digitaley Drive, to test my knowledge of Data Analysis, after completing data Bootcamp with them.

## Problem Statement

Dano Airlines, a UK-based airline is facing a critical decline in customer satisfaction, with the satisfaction rate dropping below 50% for the first time. To address this pressing issue and restore satisfaction levels, there is a need to analyze the extensive dataset of passenger feedback and evaluation metrics. The key factors contributing to low satisfaction levels will be determined, by understanding passenger preferences and pain points and developing a data-driven strategy for enhancing overall customer experience.

## Method of Analysis
Power BI. Power BI is a powerful data analysis tool, used in performing different statistical analyses and visualization. For this project, I made use of:

● Power Query

● DAX

● Data Modeling

● Data Cleaning

● Star Rating

● Filters

● Data Visualization

## Data Modeling

The model is a single-table Schema. The dataset comes in a single table that has all the necessary information for the analysis.
