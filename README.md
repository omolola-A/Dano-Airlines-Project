## Introduction

This a PowerBI Project aimed to address the significant drop in customer satisfaction, with the satisfaction rate dipping under 50% for the first time at **Dano Airlines**, a UK-based airline headquartered in London, United Kingdom. To address this challenge, a data-driven strategy is proposed to improve satisfaction levels across key areas. Through analysis of passenger feedback and evaluation of various factors influencing satisfaction.

## Data Source

The dataset was given by Digitaley Drive, to test my knowledge of Data Analysis, after completing data Bootcamp with them.

## Problem Statement

Dano Airlines, a UK-based airline is facing a critical decline in customer satisfaction, with the satisfaction rate dropping below 50% for the first time. To address this pressing issue and restore satisfaction levels, there is a need to analyze the extensive dataset of passenger feedback and evaluation metrics. The key factors contributing to low satisfaction levels will be determined, by understanding passenger preferences and pain points and developing a data-driven strategy for enhancing overall customer experience.

## Method of Analysis
Power BI. Power BI is a powerful data analysis tool, used in performing different statistical analyses and visualization. For this project, I made use of:

● Power Query

● DAX

● Data Modeling

● Data Cleaning

● Star Rating

● Filters

● Data Visualization

## Data Modeling

The model is a single-table Schema. The dataset comes in a single table that has all the necessary information for the analysis.

The dashboard contains the following:

1. Overall Satisfaction Score Distribution: The satisfaction rate has fallen below 50%, indicating a critical issue that requires immediate attention. Analyzing the distribution of satisfaction scores can provide insights into areas of improvement.
2. Passenger Segmentation: Understanding satisfaction levels across different passenger demographics, and travel types is crucial. Analyzing the total number of passengers, their average age, and class of travel.
3. Factors Influencing Satisfaction: Cleanliness, seat comfort, service quality, food and drink, and overall experience are primary factors contributing to passenger satisfaction. Identifying the areas with low satisfaction star ratings can prioritize improvement efforts.

## Analysis

The visual above provides a comprehensive view of the total number of passengers of Dano Airlines at the time of the survey. The dataset shows that 43% of 129k passengers are satisfied, while the other 57% are either neutral or dissatisfied. For the passenger age demographics, the majority of the age group(7-13) categorized as kids,(14-34) categorized as youth were neutral or dissatisfied, and the same goes for the elderly, age group (56-85). The only age group that had a high satisfaction rate recorded is the mid-age, age group (35-55). Both genders showed more neutral or dissatisfied passengers than satisfied ones. The majority of passengers are traveling by Business class and also returning customers. The star ratings show how various factors like Seat Comfort, Arrival Time Convenience, ease of Online Booking, Gate Location, onboard service, In-flight Wi-Fi service, In-flight Entertainment, and Baggage Handling affect passenger satisfaction. Through analysis of passenger feedback and evaluation of various factors influencing satisfaction, targeted actions can be implemented to enhance overall customer experience and restore satisfaction rates.  

## Conclusion and Recommendations
### Recommendations
- Cleanliness should be Enhanced. Rigorous cleanliness measures should be put in place across all areas, including lounges, aircraft, and facilities.
- Comfort Amenities should be improved. Invest in upgrading seating, legroom, and in-flight entertainment systems to enhance passenger's comfort.
- Improved Service Quality. Implement technology solutions for streamlined service delivery and real-time issue resolution. Comprehensive training should also be given to staff to deliver exceptional service and handle customer inquiries effectively.
- Services should be Tailored toward passenger preferences and historical behavior. Special offers and loyalty programs should be introduced, and personalized communication to enhance the overall experience.
- Enable Continuous feedback mechanism to gather real-time insights from passengers, and analyze feedback data regularly to identify emerging trends and areas for improvement.

 ### Conclusion
 Dano Airlines dataset analysis provides insights into passenger segments and satisfaction levels. By prioritizing initiatives to enhance cleanliness, comfort, service quality, and overall passenger experience. Dano Airlines can effectively address the current decline in satisfaction rates. Implementing a data-driven strategy with a focus on continuous improvement and personalized customer engagement will not only restore satisfaction levels but also strengthen the airline's competitive position in the market.
